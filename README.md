## This is my blogfolio. 
I needed a place to showcase my skills, projects, and designs. So this website was born! It will also be a great way to document my journey and growth.

## Stack
For this site I used HTML, CSS, and Jekyll. I wanted to keep it simple, and easy to add content to. So that's why I chose Jekyll vs a CMS. 

## Development
I wanted this site to be a all-in-one type of site for my projects. That way I could write about them and go in depth as well as display them. I love tinkering and writing, so this is a marrage of my thought process.
